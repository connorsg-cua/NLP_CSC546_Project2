## Goal

Design a system that __evaluates workers’ task contributions__ and summarizes their strengths for bonus allocation.

#### Key Consideration

_"... to infuse a spirit of equity into the mutual relations of employers and employed; to keep before the eyes of both classes the precepts of duty and the laws of the Gospel"_ - Rerum Novarum.  
We can not forget the human element of a job and we must make sure the dignity of all people is upheld. We can not reduce a person or the work they do to something that is just transactional.

### Technical Requirements

- Use at least two transformer models from 🤗 transformers (e.g., xlm-roberta-base, facebook/bart-large-cnn, google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail, Mistral-7B-Instruct-Summarize-64k).
- Integrate NER + Summarization + Generation into a functional pipeline.
- Evaluate with the usual metrics.
- Provide a concise demo app or notebook (e.g., Streamlit UI).

### Deliverables
1. Problem Brief (2 pages) – Motivation, data sources, and architecture diagram.
2. Technical Documentation (one per team, 3 – 5 pages) – Models, training details, metrics, error analysis, and discussion.
3. Demo App / Notebook – Interactive NER + Summarization + Generation pipeline (ready to run).
4. Presentation – Each team will present its work in two weeks, with a 15-minute slot per team (including Q&A).
